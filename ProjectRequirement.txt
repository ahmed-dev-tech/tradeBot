I will need a crypto trading bot with backtesting and plotting capabilities for visualization. 
A simple UI with a few options for my backtesting is fine.
It needs to be able to connect with both Kraken and Binance but not at the same time. 
Just having an option to select which exchange to use is enough.
Also, a connection with telegram to receive notifications about new trades and to be able to 
show some basic information about my open trades.
I don't wish to share my strategy, I will add the strategy myself with the limited knowledge 
I have in python. Hopefully it won't be a problem.
A function to tell the bot how many consecutive signals to open a position. 
Let's say my indicators give me a buy signal for the current candle. 
The next candle also qualify as a signal, I want to buy again.
A function to tell the bot how many total trades to have open for each crypto pair and 
total open trades for all crypto pairs combined.
A function to tell the bot which crypto pairs to trade.
In case there is a signal and I don't have enough of the specific asset to trade, 
it should ignore the signal.
Also, the bot needs to be able to use its function when the base currency is 
BTC, ETH and Euro. For example, MANA/BTC, MANA/ETH, MANA/Euro.
Finally, I would like to have the stake amount in Euro. 
Let's say I set the stake amount as 100 euro for each trade. 
The bot will need to see how many of each coin are worth 100 euro and use this amount of 
coins for the trade.
